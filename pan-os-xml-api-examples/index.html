<h1>PAN-OS XML API Examples</h1>
PAN-OS has a very comprehensive XML API, and you'll find under the hood that the PAN-OS web GUI itself uses this API (try browsing to https://{{yourdevice}}/api or https://{{yourdevice}}/debug and have a look around).<br>
<br>
In 2019, I'd recommend that your automation efforts should focus on Ansible and Terraform to achieve your objectives, or if you're using Python or Golang then use the relevant SDK<br>
<br>
However, there are occasions like testing or development where a quick shell script is useful, and for this you may want to call the PAN-OS XML API directly. There is plenty of documentation for the XML API, but as an addendum, I've started collating useful examples of API calls. You can find them <a href=https://gist.github.com/jamesholland-uk/cd688034f1b5a0ec110b474fb7c3f7e1>here</a>.<br>
