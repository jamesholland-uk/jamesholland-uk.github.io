<h1>Full Stack Journey: "The Future of Security"</h1>
I've been listening to the <a href=https://packetpushers.net/series/full-stack-journey>Full Stack Journey podcast</a> for a few months; it's another great example alongside <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20201020023611/https://packetpushers.net/series/datanauts-podcast/Datanauts>Datanauts</a> of a podcast which does a great job of both education and light-hearted entertainment, covering multiple disciplines within IT.<br>
<br>
I whole-heartedly subscribe the ideas of breaking down silos and working across functional teams in order to make IT as efficient, orchestrated and auotmated as posssible, both to enhance security but also reliability. Scott and I formulated an idea for a show specifically about IT security, covering the "state of the nation", the opportunites to improve particularly with regards to automation, and what the future holds for IT security. And as always with Full Stack Journey, we tried to get make it real-world and actionable.<br>

The show was published on 17th July 2018:<br>
