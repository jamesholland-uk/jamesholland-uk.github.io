<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>When I didn't renew with my hosting provider, I thought I'd get this site back online in a few days, and nobody would notice anyway. Neither happened. People (three at time of this git commit, which is three more than I expected) did notice (and actually contacted me to say it was a shame the site's content was unavailable), and other things in life have prevented me having the time to redo this site properly. So for now, here is the content back, in a vey quick-and-dirty plain style, on the same old URLs for the sake of poeple's bookmarks.</p>
