<h1>Datanauts: "The Future Of Infrastructure Security"</h1>
I've been a keen listener to the Datanauts podcast since 2015, and really enjoy how Ethan and Chris pull together topics and stories from the broad spectrum of IT.<br>
<br>
I got in touch with them to share an idea for a show about the background of where IT security has come from, and where it's going in the future. Given that security now touches so many parts of IT outside of just traditional port and protocol firewalls from the 1990s, like virtualisation, application stacks, user directories, public and private cloud, and software-defined everything, they were happy to host a show on this topic and discuss how security folks have branched out from their silo.<br>
<br>
The show was published on 7th June 2017:<br>
